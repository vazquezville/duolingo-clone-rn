# duolingo-clone-rn

Duolingo clone developed in react native with expo, as a project for a react native course. Includes a json with dummy data to feed the app. User has five tries to finish the level. If the app is closed, it will keep the current state of the game in the local storage. It had three different kind of questions: fill the question with given options, choosing between multiple images and open writing questions.
